=========

A dirt simple way of reporting your statuses each day. Go to the page, add your status. Browse old statuses.

## Contributing
1. Fork.
2. Make a feature branch.
3. Do your thing. (Include tests. Make sure all tests pass.)
4. Push it back to Github.
5. Create a Pull Request.

## Roadmap
1. Prevent multiple statuses on a day for a single user.
2. Project owners. Someone to coordinate things.
2. Multiple projects. Right now it's just the one.
3. Authentication. Let's keep things simple for now. A project owner would create a project, then invite people to it. This is kind of security through obscurity, but for now it's good enough.
4. Send a message when someone lists a block. (Perhaps through Safari push notifications?)
